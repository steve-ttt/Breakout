# Breakout
An excersize in learning C++ and/with the SFML framework 


Yet another Breakout? 

In an attempt to learn C++ I have decided that building games from scratch would be a good learning path. So here is my first game. Consider it a DEMO , it is fully playable but not a completely polished game. But it achieves the basic aims and was a good learning excersize in building games from scratch in C++ with SFML library. 


The compiled file is for linux (as I don't have a windoze) you may need to apt-get install or yum install the SFML libraries if your distro doesn't come with them pre-installed. 

Dependiancies:
Requires the SFML library installed
